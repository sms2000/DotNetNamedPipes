The DotNetNamedPipes library and test applications is a Proof of Concept. Intended to be used instead of .NET Frameworks WCF (C) Microsoft when running with .NET 6.
The original WCF port to .NET 6 lacks the Pipes support, so this library is intended to close the gap.

* Free for all

* Use on your own risk. Not of a production quality.

* Pipes IPC only (on the same machine)

* Tested on Windows 10/11 and Ubuntu 20.04 with .NET 6 framework installed.

* No documentation provided yet. 
  Use TestServer and TestClient and your imagination.
